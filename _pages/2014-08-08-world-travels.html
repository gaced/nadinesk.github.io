Me at sunset at the Masai Mara Reserve in Kenya, hanging by a tree with a blue shirt on, with a Masai man in the foreground. (Yes, in which I photoshop myself onto <a href="http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/060/cache/kenya_6020_600x450.jpg" target="#">this</a> photo, by Jen Eudy.) The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maasai_Mara" target="#">Masai Mara</a> is a game reserve in Kenya, contiguous with the Serengeti in Tanzania. It is named after the Masai people, and "mara," meaning spotted in Maa (Masai language), owing to its spotted appearance, from the spots including from trees, scrubs, and cloud shadows. The Masai Mara has an exceptional population of lions, leopards, and cheetahs; it also has an annual migration of zebras, Thompson gazelles, wildebeasts, to and from the Serengeti, called the Great Migration. </p>

Me at a cafe on a street in Paris, with the Eiffel Tower in the background. (Oh yes, in which I photoshop myself onto <a href="http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/countries/france-photos/#/paris-france-corner_6715_600x450.jpg" target="#">this</a> photo. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower" target="#">Eiffel Tower</a> is named after Gustav Eiffel, whose company built and designed the tower. It was erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the World's Fair, which would celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Parisian cafes are awesome, and are different from coffee shops as we think of them in the U.S. They have fully equipped kitchens and serve meals any time of the day, and have full bars and wine also. </p>

Me and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. (Yes, in which I photoshop myself onto this <a href="http://instagram.com/p/rIZkJtlyUf/?modal=true" target="#">amazing photo</a> on <a href="http://instagram.com/spono?modal=true" target="#">instagram.com/spono</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" target="#">Sierra Nevada</a> is a mountain range between California's Central Valley and the Basin and Great Basin Ranges. The Sierra is 400 miles north-to-south and 70 miles east-to-west. It includes Lake Tahoe, Mount Whitney (the highest point in the contiguous United States), and the Yosemite Valley. </p>
