I moved to New York City from Mountain View, CA, with my husband and my now-two-year-old son, in February. Mountain View is small, pretty, easy, convenient, place to live. New York City is a densely populated, crowded, vibrant, young, city. Aspects of my life have changed since we moved here because the weather is so different, I don’t have a car any more, there are less open, outdoor spaces, and there are more activity and food options. Some things have become more convenient in NYC, but some things have become less convenient. Mountain View is at the center of Silicon Valley, which, as everyone knows, is where so many apps and tech are created that are intended to make lives easier or better, or both. I have more of a need for these apps in NYC because of the way the city is set up, and I’ve been using them much more here. 

### Food
Apps for food delivery is key without a car and when you have a toddler, in NYC. There are so many good restaurants here. It’s easy to just eat out all the time. [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) make it easier for me to cook at home, and [Munchery](https://www.munchery.com//) lets me get healthier food delivery. [Seamless](https://www.seamless.com/) was a good way to get delivery from different restaurants to try them out, but I don’t use it as much now. 

I’ve been using [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) on a weekly basis to get groceries delivered on the weekend from Whole Foods. It’s about $15 dollars extra for the delivery, but without a car, I’d have to take a taxi. The delivery cost is approximately how much I’d have to pay to take a taxi or [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) home. I don’t have to spend the time to go grocery shopping on the weekends, and that adds to the time I can spend with my son. The downsides to using [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) are: I can’t pick and choose the quality of produce I’m getting; I miss out on seasonal fruits and veggies I would only remember are available by going to the store; and sometimes a wrong item is delivered (for example, a giant box of like 50  apple sauces instead of, like seven).  Overall, [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) has been a tremendous help for me in getting groceries, cooking meals at home, and making lunches for my son when he’s at daycare. 

I’ve been using [Munchery](https://www.munchery.com//) to get prepared food delivered when I want a healthier, and often, cheaper option than ordering out from a restaurant. I love that I can decide I don’t want to cook dinner early in the day, order my food then, and know that it’s going to come during a specific time at night. The food options are much less greasy and heavy than food from restaurants near us, and it’s often less expensive. They also have kids’ meal options, which is great. The downsides for me are that the food is sometimes less appetizing because it arrives cold and you have to heat it up; and sometimes the food, while healthier, isn’t that tasty. But when I’m busy but don’t feel like cooking or bringing myself closer as close to artery-clogging, I love [Munchery](https://www.munchery.com//). 

I used [Seamless](https://www.seamless.com/) for food delivery more when we first moved here, before the joy of trying new restaurants had subsided, and before I gained five pounds after taking advantage of all the NYC food. I don’t use  it as much, or at all, now. I also find their rating system to be inaccurate, and it doesn’t really facilitate choosing a place.

When we do go out to eat as a family, it’s more of a treat now, and we want to find somewhere good. We use [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com) to sort through all the restaurants. I used it a lot in San Francisco also. Here in NYC, using [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com) requires more inspection of the ratings, the number of ratings, and choosing between places that all look really good. 

### Health
Health maintenance in NYC, for me, requires more of an effort than it did in the Bay Area. There is an abundance of outdoor space, parks, and activities, in the Bay Area: there are beautiful beaches, mountains, and lakes at your fingertips. The weather is great year-round for running or hiking. The produce is better and the restaurants served up more organic, fresh, less greasy food. But in NYC, I have to say no to so many pastries, pizza slices, chocolates, popsicles, and ice cream trucks, every day. Most days, I fail to say no to at least one of those things. The large, magnificent landscapes are missing here. You have to find a place: I’ve found the Riverside, and I love it. But most of the time, I don’t have enough time to run along the Hudson River. I use the treadmill or other things in the gym. (But, unfortunately, no rower.) 

I use [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) running, which I love, if I’m on the treadmill. If I’m on the Elliptical (for shame!), I will watch a video on my Lynda app for some skill development- how’s that for multitasking! Exercising and skill development at the same time!

On weekends, I walk a lot with my son (Riverside, Central Park Zoo and Central Park everything, CMOM, etc). I use the [Apple Health](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203037) app to track my steps and see trends in the distances I walk. 

This city is busy and hectic. I’ve just started using some apps to help myself relax and become a little more mentally calm amidst the hustle and bustle. I use [Moodnotes](http://www.moodnotes.thriveport.com/) to track my mood, both the highs and the lows. I use [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) to do quick meditation in the morning. I can foresee that soon, I won’t use [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) soon because I’ll meditate on my own. But it’s good to use now to develop the habit again. 

### Transportation
[Uber](https://www.uber.com/). I’ve been using [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) in NYC, and it’s great. I use [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) Family for the car seats for my son. The positives: they have car seats; the cars come almost immediately; they’re clean; the drivers are nicer; I don’t have to look for my wallet at the end of the trip; I can wait indoors if it’s raining or snowing because the app shows me when exactly a car’s coming; and it’s so much nicer to ride around and look at NYC from a nice, clean, air-conditioned car. Two improvements I can see in terms of child seats are easier-to-install seats because sometimes drivers have to curb their car to install it; and more family [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) cars in the Midtown West area :) 

### Day Planning
The weather in NYC varies so much, and so much more than it does in the Bay Area. I’ve been finding myself using the Weather app to plan what to wear and see if I should bring an umbrella. I use [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) to find grocery stores near me at lunch, and other errand-related places, like the post office, a bank, pharmacy, or a notary. An app I used more in the Bay Area than here, is [Google Shopping Express](https://www.google.com/express/). I still use it here, but have probably gotten smarter about how much to order each time, and so I need it less. 


### Documenting the Day
I’m always taking pictures of my son. I use [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) to document moments I want to remember, [Hyperlapse](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8) to give a sense of his energy and activity, and [Layout](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/layout-from-instagram/id967351793?mt=8) when I want to capture a ton of things in one image. 

I also started using [Matter](http://www.matterapp.co/), an app that adds 3D images to photos. It’s fun. The downside to all of these things is the amount of time I waste using them. 

### Entertainment
I use the [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) app to entertain my son when we do go out to eat, which is rarely now. My son also loves an app called [Toddler Counting 123](http://www.giggleup.com/toddler-counting-123/) by Giggle Up, where he taps various objects that change to numbers. “Game!” he says to me sometimes. He can even navigate to the icon himself now. We also use [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) (BoJack!) and the Remote app for our Apple TV. 

For my own entertainment, I use a few apps on the train during my commute, and at work. I use the [Kindle app](https://www.itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle-read-books-ebooks-magazines/id302584613?mt=8) to read, and the [Tap Towers](https://www.itunes.apple.com/us/app/tap-towers/id490309734?mt=8) game on the train. I sometimes listen to Apple Music (streaming) at work. 

That basically covers most of the apps I use. It’s an ever-changing and evolving list. 

Some Apps/Tech I Want: 
*   The Withings scale and HealthMate app. 
*   iPad air or mini. 
*   Apps on iPad: Paper app, iPhone wireframe apps
*   Apple watch. 
*   I want to use Apple Pay and Passbook more to pay for things. 
*   I want an app that makes it easier to get clothes in my style that fit me, easier, and to deliver to me.
