<p>I'm studying for the Java class final now. I'm excited to have the break between this class and the Intermediate Java, and the C ++ class that starts in mid-January. I plan on completing an app and submitting it to the Apple app store during this break. </p>
<p>Regarding the Developing for IOS class that I started watching the lectures for on ITunes U, I've decided that, since it's not for credit, I can't trick myself into thinking it is. The Assignments have proven too difficult for me right now, and so I threw my hands up, completed the Assignment I was stuck on through someone's work on Github, and have decided to move on with the other lectures. I think after the intermediate Java class, I'll have enough knowledge to do the assignments in a reasonable amount of time, but it's not worth it for me to spend the time figuring it out right now. I'm really enjoying the lectures, regardless. </p>
