I'm getting started with [Core Plot](https://github.com/core-plot) in iOS. My goal is to use Core Plot to graph Core Data data. 

I installed Core Plot with the help of the [Core Plot wiki](https://github.com/core-plot/core-plot/wiki/Using-Core-Plot-in-an-Application), and screen shots and further help from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28236419/ios-coreplot-how-to-install) Stack Overflow answer. 

I had to search around a little more and waste a little more time because I didn't understand why the libCore framework that I was adding was showing up in red. 

I crossed my fingers, and hoped for the best, and tried [this simple example](http://www.mobdevel.com/?p=96). 

And then the joy, the feeling that it was all worth it to get up at 5 am this morning. I got a graph!

Temporary joy before the next behemoth, as I tackle Core Plot and Core Data.
