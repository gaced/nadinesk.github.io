<p>I worked on my last D3.js project two to three weeks ago, and put it up on bl.ocks <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/nadinesk/b97540e8bd46485deacd">here</a> with code also on github <a href="https://github.com/nadinesk/BAZipsComp">here</a>. </p>
<p>Between that time and now, I had an two rounds of interviews with Hacker School in New York, and was not accepted. It was a long-shot, being a total novice to "programming" (quotes either because of impostor syndrome or because I am actually a programming impostor!). The first interview was a cinch, with about 15 minutes of conversation on Skype with a facilitator there. The second interview was so nerve-wracking for me. It basically took over everything else I was doing, between my many domestic responsibilities and any other projects I might have begun after the SF Bay Area choropleth.</p>
<p>And here's why: it was a pair programming interview. Me?! Pair programming?! That was wild. I had never programmed professionally, and here I was going over my code with someone who's really good at this stuff? I decided to refactor a program I had written in Haskell (<a href="https://github.com/nadinesk/USMap">here</a>), which creates basically a choropleth map, but I had done it last November from the ground-up, linking SVG coordinates to points to create lines, including Bezier curves, and several other complications. I decided to refactor that code instead of working on a D3.js project, because the instructions specifically said not to work on something that involved a framework. </p>
<p>I hadn't looked at Haskell or my code since last December, and suddenly I had to remember everything I had done, and I had left myself about two days to do it. I got as prepared as I could; the interview proved that I really am not prepared for pair programming. I have gotten to where I am through sheer force of will, and without having very good fundamentals. The interview was quite embarrassing for me. BUT I do have to pat myself on the back for going through with 45 minutes of skype pair programming with someone who really knows their stuff. It's like I crossed some kind of weird line that suddenly showed up out of nowhere and dared me to cross it. </p>
<p>It turns out, there's nothing on the other side but the experience had. Not totally true, though. Being forced to talk about something so awkwardly with someone for so long because I didn't really know the answers to questions I was being asked but it was kind of assumed I would, has made interactions with strangers way less daunting. Also, the experience forced me to realize how lacking in fundamentals I am. </p>
<p>Since then, I have completed four weeks of the free CS101 <a href="http://online.stanford.edu/course/computer-science-101-Summer-2014">online course</a> with Stanford, and realizing this might not be rigorous enough, I've signed up for another class on object-oriented programming that will be for credit. </p>
<p>I've changed the theme of this wordpress blog, using Isola as a springboard, and altering it to look more simple, and more like medium.com's layout. (It's still a work in progress because I want to change the menu page and a few other features.) I changed the theme's CSS to make the theme look like Isola, here: </p>

<p>I've other projects in place, which I will post here and elsewhere around the Internets in short order!</p>
