When I first began to make the app I'm developing, I created mockups of it using Adobe Illustrator. But as I am beginning to create more scenes, I'm discovering different ways these all need to and should connect together. This is requring me to make several changes to my storyboard, which is causing me several issues. 

I had to go back to the drawing board (almost literally, in a more technical sense), and create a new, blank XCode project, with just the storyboard, planning out how the main dashboard, for lack of a better word, should connect to the rest of the views. As I was creating the app, I was more focused on the single scenes of the mockup more or less going according to plan -- which is to say, there was some similar content there, which is to say, what was the  point of spending time on my mockups -- and less on the way everything should fit together. I created little hacks and fixes as I went along to include the scenes I needed. Then I had to go back and do it the way it should actually be. I'm not even 15% of the way done on this project, but I do plan on being wiser about putting together the scenes the first time. This will save me so much time and frustration. 

I had begun on Core Plot, but then needed to add my graphs, didn't have a clear segue from the other scenes there, created a new scene, realized I needed to change my whole configuration, and that has taken a few days. Luckily, I woke up early this morning, fixed some things, and now I'm doing a mini-celebration because I'm ready to start on Core Plot and Core Data, as I had intended to days ago. 

I discovered the answer to one of these questions I had spent hours on yesterday and this morning on Stack Overflow. I was so thankful, that I signed into Stack Overflow for the first time in years, to upvote an answer. And that's when I just discoverd that one of my questions about a photo gallery from about 4 years ago, has over 10K views, and I earned a "Popular Question" badge. :)
