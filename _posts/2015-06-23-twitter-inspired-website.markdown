### Miles and Miles to Go, with a Few Initial Steps
I've, at least, temporarily, committed (temporarly commited...hm...) to my personal website design, inspired by the current Twitter login/home page. I went with it after several other design iterations I had made, because it looked the most professional. I am getting back into web development, and this is a work in progress, and I have made progress during process (and, apparently, rhymes). 

I don't love the boxes and hovers with photos that makes a central part of my site, but out of an unwillingness to remove something I spent time making to resemble what I wanted, I can't yet discard it. 

Among other things, I have been thinking about how I have come to appreciate the value, fun, and sometimes, beauty of the interactive elements of a web page, and look forward to using that more with JavaScript/JQuery. 

### Blogging with Jekyll and Using Github
Customizing my blog using Jekyll and Github has been valuable for me. I have learned to use git much more, and it is pretty awesome. Customizing my blog with Jekyll also has given me a view into other aspects of CSS, and using SASS. 

Hey, it's all been fun and I love it, and I'm really looking forward to making more. 

And so, what I originally came here for
