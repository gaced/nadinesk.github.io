### Miles and Miles to Go, with a Few Initial Steps
I've, at least, temporarily committed to a website design I made for my home page, inspired by the current Twitter login/home page. I used this design after several other iterations because it looked the most professional. I am getting back into web development, and this is a work in progress. 

### Responsive Web Design and Web Interactivity 

I used Bootstrap for my home page, which made responsive web design (for different screen sizes and devices) easier, because of their easy-to-understand grid system. I have left my site in a working state for mobile, but it is one of the things I will need to improve. 

One challenge I faced in creating responsive web design, was switching from hovers over the boxes on desktops/laptops to clicks on divs (and anywhere off divs) on mobile. I used a lot of repetitive JQuery to make accomplish the change in user interactions with the site, and could refactor it to make it simpler. 

I am thinking of ways to replace the purple hover/click boxes with something that not only looks better, but employs better web interactivity. I plan to learn more about and implement these methods (through JQuery and CSS Animations). 

### Blogging with Jekyll and Using Github
Customizing my blog using Jekyll and Github has been valuable for me. I have learned to use git much more, and it is pretty awesome/amazing. Customizing my blog with Jekyll also has given me a view into other aspects of CSS, and using SASS. 

It's all been fun and I love it, and I'm really looking forward to making more. 

And so, what I originally came here for
