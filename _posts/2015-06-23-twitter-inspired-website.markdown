### Miles and Miles to Go, with a Few Initial Steps
I've, at least, temporarily committed to a website design I made for my home page, inspired by the current Twitter login/home page. I used this design after creating several other design iterations because it looked the most professional. I am getting back into web development, and this is a work in progress. One thing that has been a fun challenge, but an essential part of making sites, is making responsive web design, to fit different screen sizes and devices. I used Bootstrap for my home page, which made responsive design easier, because of their easy-to-understand grid system. I have left my site in a working state for mobile, but it is one of the things I will need to improve. 
I don't love the boxes and hovers with photos that are a central part of my site; I am thinking of ways to replace it with something better. Along these lines of interactivity, I have been thinking about how useful web interactivity can be, and how to include this in my sites in a way that makes sense and looks good. 

### Blogging with Jekyll and Using Github
Customizing my blog using Jekyll and Github has been valuable for me. I have learned to use git much more, and it is pretty awesome/amazing. Customizing my blog with Jekyll also has given me a view into other aspects of CSS, and using SASS. 

It's all been fun and I love it, and I'm really looking forward to making more. 

And so, what I originally came here for
