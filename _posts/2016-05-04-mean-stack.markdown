I am learning to build a web app with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular JS, and Node.js). I used [this](https://hackhands.com/how-to-get-started-on-the-mean-stack/) tutorial to set it up. 

I successfully deployed a test app to Heroku using Heroku's [tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mean-apps-restful-api). 

The web app tutorial creates a contact list based on user input. 

My next step is to create user authentication for this app.
