<p>I've just begun taking the Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in Java class this week. I'm doing the readings for the first week. Let's just say this: it will be challenging. Web Development might be put on the back-burner while I delve more into computer science (rather than computer programming). I'm nervous. </p>
