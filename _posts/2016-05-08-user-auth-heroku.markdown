I'm making progress on learning and using the MEAN stack. I successfully created user authentication and used [this](http://www.sitepoint.com/user-authentication-mean-stack/) tutorial for help. I ran it locally first and then deployed it to Heroku. I'm now going to examine everything and add additional functionality and...a general purpose to the site.
