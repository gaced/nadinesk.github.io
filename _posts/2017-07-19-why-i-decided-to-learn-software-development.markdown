I like to make web pages. I get a great sense of satisfaction when I lay out a page and see it on the web. I want to be able to do more with web pages, and have tools at my fingertips to think up a concept and create it. That’s why I decided to learn software development. 

I made iPhone apps before I really knew how to program, and that felt very clunky. I started learning Java and C, and was glad to find out that, not only do I like creating web pages with HTML/CSS and some Javascript, but I also really enjoy learning new programming languages and solving problems with them. 

I also love manipulating data and creating data visualizations. I recently learned R, and this has given me some of the tools to be more capable, fast, and thoughtful when working with data. I’ve always discovered ways to automate tasks at my jobs, first with Excel and VBA, and now with R and SQL. I’ve fully automated tasks at my jobs that previously were very time-consuming (weeks, or months), creating R scripts with SQL queries that allow the creation of large datasets, and the conclusions drawn from them, reproducible. I can also continue to get the satisfaction from creating pages with R Markdown. 

There’s so much that can be done with software development. And I want to be able to do it all. :smile:
