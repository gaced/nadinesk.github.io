This data visualization shows the number of armed conflicts by region, from 1946 to 2013 (68 years), with the circles' radii increasing with larger numbers of conflicts. It is also <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/nadinesk/4c5b949d027fb5a4724c" target="#">here</a>, replete with code. </p>
<p><b>Data</b><br />
The data is from the <a href="http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/datasets/">Uppsala Department of Peace and Conflict Research</a>. I added a column called "Region" to the most recent (2013) <a href="http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/datasets/ucdp_prio_armed_conflict_dataset/">UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset</a>, and coded the region of the Location provided in the dataset of the armed conflict. I coded the regions based on Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Regions_of_the_world">Regions of the World</a> template. If there was more than  location for one conflict, I divided the conflict into equal parts per region. I used Excel's countifs function to count the number of conflicts by year and region, resulting in the csv file with the data. </p>
<p><b>Code</b>:<br />
My idea for this data visualization was to begin with something more basic -- a few circles, and build onto some complexity (rather than beginning with something complex, like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/feb/12/state-of-the-union-reading-level">this</a>, and trying to understand it or change its features when I didn't fully understand it). I think this was a good idea for me. I customized this visualization and understand, not only d3.js more, but also JavaScript, which happens to be essential to learning D3. Reading through <a href="http://www.macwright.org/presentations/dcjq/" target="#">this</a> presentation, and <a href="http://slides.com/annaps/d3-journey-to-the-source/#/" target="#">this</a> presentation (which I found <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/" target="#">here</a>), drove home the importance of knowing JavaScript but also the cool things one can do with D3 if they really understand it. (Here's a slide from the first presentation link.)<br />

<p>I went through the <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/" target="#">Let's Make a Bar Chart</a> tutorials to begin, and using the chart in <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/3/" target="#">Part III</a>, I changed the rectangles to circles. The final result is much different from the starting point of the bar chart in Part III. Here is a summary of the major changes:<br />
- If statements to change the color of circles based on their regions.<br />
- A slider that would change the radii of the circles based on the number associated with each region and year. I used <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/10632804" target="#">d3noob's example</a> to add this element.<br />
- For loops to loop through all the years and update the circles' radii and labels based on the value of the slider element.<br />
- Removed the data labels using text.exit().remove(). I need help with this, because I don't really understand why I put it where I put it, and why the xaxis seems tied with it. If anyone has an explanation, that would be very welcome! </p>
<p><b>Analysis of the Data</b>:<br />
Asia has had the largest number of armed conflicts, followed by Africa, according to the data. These two regions also hold the two largest populations, in the same order. The following table shows each region's population as a percent of the total world population as of 2013, compared to the each region's number of conflicts as a percent of the total number of  to the total number of conflicts, for three years: the first year of the data, 1946; the mid-point year of the data, 1980; and the final year of the data, 2013. The table illustrates that the percent of armed conflicts by region ties fairly closely with that region's percent of the total population. The major exception is Africa, which has had a higher percent of conflicts compared to the percent of its population to the world's population. <a href="http://www.khasachi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled1.png"><img src="assets/Untitled1-300x117.png" alt="Untitled1" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181" /></a></p>
