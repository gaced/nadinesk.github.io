Here is my new and exciting blog using Jekyll! I love, love, love the simplicity so far. I left Wordpress because want to know what is going on and Wordpress is a little too much...stuff. 

I've migrated some of my old posts to this site (anything on here prior to this post), and migrated others to a standard wordpress.com blog [here][old-blog]; I kept some there because, during the import of posts to Jekyll, I lost some assets and don't find them important enough to go through the trouble of saving images for this blog.
