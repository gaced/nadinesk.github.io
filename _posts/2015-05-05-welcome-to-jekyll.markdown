I'm building a new blog using Jekyll, because I want to know what is going on and Wordpress is a little too much...stuff...I've migrated my old wordpress blog to a standard wordpress.com (as opposed to wordpress.org) blog [here]: http://khasachi.wordpress.com. 

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
