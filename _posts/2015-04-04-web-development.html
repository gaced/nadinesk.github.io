<p>I've begun to dip the tippy tops of my toes into web development over the past week, during my time off from completing my C++ and Intermediate Java classes, until my course on advanced data structures and algorithms in Java begins. </p>
<p>I watched the Web Design Fundamentals videos on Lynda.com, and am developing a plan of action. I'm really looking forward to learning more, recording my progress here, and best of all, putting it into practice. </p>
<p>Every time I gain more programming skills, I think, I'm so excited about THIS. But really, I am so excited about learning web development -- it's what I first tried out those many, many years ago with HTML before CSS, before blogs, on Geocities, with my hardcore Beastie Boys fan page (replete with mouseover scrolling!). There are aspects of mobile development and Java that I love too, and I'm just getting my feet wet. But I'm so looking forward to it and making things with my new skills. </p>
<p>Other news: I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0631490/">Bill Nighy</a> (currently on Broadway in Skylight) and Paul Hegarty, of the iPhone Application Development course fame (plus, I'm sure, many, many, more, more useful things) in the past two days. I only fangirled one of them, interrupting their walk down the street (hint: his online lectures helped me develop an app). </p>
