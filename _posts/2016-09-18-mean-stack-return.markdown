I've made my way back after a long break spent learning and practicing/using other things like R and more D3.js, to the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js). I began trying to use this a while ago, but was very confused. I had to go back to the basics and start over again, because this is not one of those things that I could just intuitively pick up on. But after much ado, I followed [this tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mean-apps-restful-api), and based on that, I created a small web app that will take in user information, save it to a database, and get that data once posted to JSON.  It is deployed on heroku [here](https://fathomless-savannah-68425.herokuapp.com/#/). Hey! That was fun. And it is fun to have fun...as I devolve into Dr. Seuss...Also Bootstrap is pretty sweet.
