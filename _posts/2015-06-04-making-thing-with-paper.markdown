I just downloaded the [Paper App](https://www.fiftythree.com/paper), which I'm having fun doodling with. I don't have the pencil (yet) but I will probably get it. It's such a fun and well-designed app.

It's also fun - and helpful - to make wireframes with them...don't worry, my "illustrations" will get better! 

Also, I've gone back to work. Here's Zach, post-work during my first week.
