A few days ago, I looked at my phone and noticed a chart showing what looked like pedometer data. And this is when I discovered that Apple's Health App has been tracking my number of steps since I got my iPhone 6+ in October 2014. Today, I decided to look into that data. I wanted to see how many steps I cover in an average day, how it changed from month-to-month, if there were any patterns in how far I walked on certain days of the week. Also I just moved to NYC at the beginning of February (well, January 30 to be specific), and I was interested to see how the walking distance I covered changed since I moved. 

The data from the Health App can't be exported from the app itself, so I downloaded the QS Access, which allowed me to create a table of my steps and miles walked, each day from 10/2/15 (when I got my phone) to 5/28/15 (today). I downloaded the data into Excel and quickly created some charts to get some answers to my questions. Not suprisingly -- or maybe yes, suprisingly, since we moved in the middle of the freezing NYC winter, from the blissful, sunny CA weather -- my steps and miles walked increased since my move to the big city. I run, and in Mountain View, there was a great trail behind my apartment (Stevens Creek Trail), where I ran about 5-6 miles most mornings. The weather here was bad in NYC when we moved, but I still went on the treadmill at least three to four times per week in the first couple of months, which is a great way to develop a deep, profound dread of the treadmill; but I started running outside in April, and in May, my running has decreased, probably because I am walking a little more, and probably because I want to make sure that the increased pastries I'm consuming in this food-filled, food-centric city, really get noticed on me. Also, I've been walking more this month -- and did spend a week in San Diego, where I played tennis, and walked less. 

The charts!
