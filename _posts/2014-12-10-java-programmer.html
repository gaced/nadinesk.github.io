<p>The grades are up and I got an A in the Java class! I think my celebration will consist of calories in the form of a small cup of eggnog (okay, and RHOBH). It's great to have this feeling of accomplishment. :D </p>
<p>I'm going through the demo for one of the lectures for the Developing for iOS class on ITunes U (by Stanford). So excited to start on my next iOS project. </p>
